# Sudoku_Solver
 This python program allows users to encode/save/load sudoku grids, and can attempt to solve grids.

## Usage
First of all, in a terminal window, navigate to the folder containing this code (with the command `cd`).

Then, run the file `SudokuSolver.py` with the following command:
```
python SudokuSolver.py

From here on out, the program should more or less guide you through the process.
