# Sudoku_Solver
 This python program allows users to encode/save/load sudoku grids, and can attempt to solve grids.
 
 ## TODOs
 1. Add a functionality to reset the full grid to an empty grid
 2. Add a way to show a step-by-step solution of the grid (should be possible by simply recording the cells that we find the value of, in the order we find them, and then showing it nicely to the user)
 3. Add a more advanced resolution technique (since the current SudokuSolver is quite weak)

## Usage
First of all, in a terminal window, navigate to the folder containing this code (with the command `cd`).

Then, run the file `SudokuSolver.py` with the following command:
```
python SudokuSolver.py
```

From here on out, the program should more or less guide you through the process.
